When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is useful in a collaborative situation  where multiple developers are involved.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? Depedent software might not compatiable with current version hosted on GitHub.
